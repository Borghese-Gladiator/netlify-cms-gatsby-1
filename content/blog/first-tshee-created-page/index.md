# My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I can explain. __It's very valuable.__ *Belligerent and numerous.* One hundred dollars.

## Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' itâ€¦ then perhaps gifts!

Yeah, lots of people did. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Professor, make a woman out of me. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!

1. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
2. Soothe us with sweet lies.
3. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

### I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. No! Don't jump! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

* Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
* You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
* Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Soothe us with sweet lies. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Ooh, name it after me!

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. You can see how I lived before I met you. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. She also liked to shut up!

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Ask her how her day was. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

Soon enough. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

We're rescuing ya. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Say what? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

Bender?! You stole the atom. You can see how I lived before I met you. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

Professor, make a woman out of me. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Now what? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
